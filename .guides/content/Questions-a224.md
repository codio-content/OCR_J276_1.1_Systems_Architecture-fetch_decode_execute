# Solution

During the fetch phase of the cycle the **control unit** sets the **program counter** to the next memory **address** to be accessed.
This is transferred to the **memory address register** and a control signal is sent to the memory which returns the instruction to the **memory data register**.
The control unit then interprets the instruction. This is the **decode** phase of the cycle.
The control unit then **executes** the instruction. 
The **arithmetic and logic unit** is used if calculations are needed. 
As the program is running data and the results of calculations are stored in the **accumulator**.

- **Program counter**
- **Memory address register**
- **Memory data register**
- **Accumulator**

The control unit sets the program counter to the memory address of the next instruction.

The address is transferred to the MAR.

The control unit sends a signal to the memory and the instruction at that address is transferred to the MDR.

The instruction is decoded and data may be stored in the accumulator as a result of that instruction.

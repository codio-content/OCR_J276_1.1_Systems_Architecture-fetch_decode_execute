The following simple program to add two numbers demonstrates how the accumulator is used.

| Memory address | Instruction|
| :------: | :-----------: |
| 0 | LOAD 3 |
| 1| ADD 4 |
| 2| STORE 5|
| 3  | 13 |
| 4| 9|
| 5 |  |

- Instruction 0 instructs the CPU to load the data in memory address 3 into the accumulator.
- Instruction 1 instructs the CPU add the number in memory address 4 to the data in the accumulator 
  â€“ which will now hold the number 22.
- Instruction 2 instructs the CPU to store the data in the accumulator into memory address 5.
